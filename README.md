# NDMF-Avatar-Optimization

NDMF-Avatar-Optimization streamlines the process of preparing avatars for deployment by compressing, validating, and tuning assets with minimal manual effort. Use it when you want consistent, repeatable optimization that fits smoothly into your asset pipeline.

## Why use this?
- **Consistency:** Apply the same optimization steps across teams and projects without relying on ad-hoc scripts.
- **Speed:** Automate compression and validation so artists and developers can focus on content instead of tooling.
- **Quality control:** Catch common avatar issues early, reducing rework before integration.

## Best results with NDMF-Merge
For large projects, pair this tool with **NDMF-Merge** to manage branches and asset updates efficiently:
- Run NDMF-Merge to pull or merge the latest asset changes into your workspace.
- Execute NDMF-Avatar-Optimization on the merged assets to normalize compression and validate files before committing.
- Commit and push the optimized assets so collaborators receive consistent, ready-to-use avatars.

This README is a work in progress; feel free to extend it with more detailed examples or troubleshooting tips as the tools evolve.
